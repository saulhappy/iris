## Background

According to ancient Greek Mythology as described in Hesiod's Theogony, Iris is the daughter of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, and the sister of the Harpies: Aello and Ocypete. During the Titan Battles, Iris was the messenger of the Olympian Gods.

Though Iris was principally associated with communication and messages, she was also believed to aid in the fulfillment of humans' prayers, either by fulfilling them herself or by bringing them to the attention of other deities.

We need more of this. Especially now, during time of development, when the world is reeling from the COVID-19 Crisis.

Iris will be a site where users can create their profiles, add where they live, contact information about themselves, where they live, and how they can help those around them. Other users would then be able to contact these people with requests for help.
